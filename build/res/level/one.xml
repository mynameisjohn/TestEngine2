	types of resources:
		*.xml - A skeleton
		*.svg - an SVG polygon
		*.png - a texture
		*.sprt - a sprite-sheet quad
		no resource attribute - just a color

		in the case of *.png or just a color, I have to check if it's a cube or a quad I guess.
		also I guess I need to handle the outline case...
		Just leave cubes the way they are, so they always use the outline texture...?
		And speaking of textures, how do I manage them? I want to avoid repetition, i.e
		several drawables using the outline texture...
		should I give the entire drawable class a map<string, GLuint>?
